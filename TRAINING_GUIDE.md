### Step 2: Initial Triage (7:15 - 7:25 AM)

**You're having coffee, reviewing the email on your phone.**

#### Your Mental Checklist:

**SOFI - Looks Interesting ✅**
- ✅ 3 insiders (including CEO and CFO) = strong signal
- ✅ Rank score 9.22 = high conviction
- ✅ $9.25 price = reasonable entry point
- ✅ Action says "Watchlist - consider small entry"
- ✅ Near 52-week low (potential value)

**PLTR - Okay but Less Compelling ⚠️**
- ⚠️ Only 2 insiders = weaker signal
- ⚠️ Lower conviction score (6.20)
- 📝 Note: Will monitor but not priority today

**RDDT - Skip ❌**
- ❌ Only 1 insider = very weak signal
- ❌ Action says "Monitor" = not urgent
- 📝 Decision: Ignore for now

**Your Decision:** **Focus on SOFI**

---

### Step 3: Quick Research (7:25 - 7:45 AM)

**Before placing ANY order, do 10-15 minutes of research.**

#### 3A. Check the Chart

Open TradingView (or Robinhood charts):
- Search: "SOFI"
- Timeframe: Daily
- Look back: 3-6 months

**What you're looking for:**
- ✅ Is it in a clear downtrend? (More risky)
- ✅ Is it bouncing off support? (Good entry)
- ✅ Is it breaking out? (Chase carefully)
- ✅ Recent volume trends

**What you see for SOFI:**
- Stock dropped from $12 to $9 over past month
- Bounced off $9.00 support level yesterday
- Currently at $9.25 (slightly above support)
- Volume slightly elevated

**Assessment:** Chart looks okay - bouncing off support ✅

---

#### 3B. Google News Check

Google: **"SOFI news"**

Look through headlines from last 3 days:

**What you're looking for:**
- ❌ Lawsuits announced
- ❌ Accounting scandals
- ❌ Major executive departures (beyond normal)
- ❌ Bankruptcy concerns
- ✅ Positive catalysts
- ✅ Earnings coming up

**What you find for SOFI:**
- No major negative news
- Quiet period before earnings (2 weeks away)
- Some analyst upgrades last week

**Assessment:** No red flags ✅

---

#### 3C. Verify Insider Buying (Optional but Smart)

Go to: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar

- Company: "SOFI"
- Filing Type: "4" (Form 4 = insider transactions)
- Look at recent filings

**What you find:**
- ✅ CEO Anthony Noto bought $200k worth on Oct 30
- ✅ CFO bought $150k on Oct 31
- ✅ Director bought $100k on Nov 1
- All open-market purchases (not option exercises)

**Assessment:** Insider buys confirmed on SEC.gov ✅

---

#### 3D. Final Decision Point

After 15 minutes of research:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Chart | ✅ Bounced off support |
| News | ✅ No negative catalysts |
| Insider buys | ✅ Verified on SEC |
| Multiple insiders | ✅ CEO + CFO + Director |
| Signal strength | ✅ Rank score 9.22 |

**Decision: I'll take a small position** 🎯

---

### Step 4: Calculate Position Size (7:45 AM)

**Never wing this - always calculate first.**

#### Your Trading Plan:

```
Total Portfolio: $10,000
Risk per trade: 3%
Max position size: $300
```

#### Calculate Shares to Buy:

```
Current SOFI price: $9.25
Position size: $300
Shares = $300 ÷ $9.25 = 32.43 shares

Round down: 32 shares
Actual investment: 32 × $9.25 = $296
```

---

#### Set Your Exit Levels BEFORE You Buy:

**Take Profit Target:**
```
Entry: $9.25
Conservative target: +8% = $9.99
Round to: $10.00 (nice round number)
Potential profit: ($10.00 - $9.25) × 32 = $24
```

**Stop Loss:**
```
Entry: $9.25
Max risk: -5% = $8.79
Round to: $8.75 (nice round number)
Max loss: ($9.25 - $8.75) × 32 = $16
```

**Time Stop:**
```
If no movement after 3 weeks: Re-evaluate or exit
Calendar reminder: November 24
```

---

### Step 5: Place the Order (8:45 AM)

**Market opens in 45 minutes. Time to place your order.**

---

#### Option A: Market Order at Open (Not Recommended)

**How to do it:**
1. Open Robinhood app
2. Search: "SOFI"
3. Tap "Trade" → "Buy"
4. Enter quantity: 32 shares
5. Order type: Market
6. Time in force: Day
7. Review → Submit

**Why NOT recommended:**
- ❌ Market orders at open get bad fills (high volatility)
- ❌ Might pay $9.40 instead of $9.25
- ❌ Loses 1.6% immediately = harder to profit

---

#### Option B: Limit Order (Recommended) ✅

**How to do it:**

1. **Open Robinhood app**

2. **Search for the ticker**
   - Tap search icon
   - Type: "SOFI"
   - Select: SoFi Technologies

3. **Tap "Trade"**
   - Green "Trade" button
   - Select "Buy"

4. **Enter quantity**
   - Type: 32
   - (Or use $ amount: $300)

5. **Change order type**
   - Tap "Market" → Change to "Limit"
   - This lets you set your max price

6. **Set limit price**
   - Enter: $9.30
   - (Slightly above current $9.25 for flexibility)

7. **Set time in force**
   - Select: "Day"
   - (Order expires end of day if not filled)

8. **Review your order**
   ```
   Buy 32 SOFI
   Limit @ $9.30
   Est. total: ~$297.60
   Day order
   ```

9. **Double-check everything**
   - ✅ Correct ticker
   - ✅ Buying (not selling)
   - ✅ 32 shares
   - ✅ Limit $9.30
   - ✅ Day order

10. **Tap "Submit Order"**

**Confirmation screen appears:**
```
✅ Order Submitted
Buy 32 SOFI
Limit $9.30
Status: Pending
```

---

**Why limit orders are better:**
- ✅ Controls your entry price
- ✅ Avoids market open volatility spikes
- ✅ If it gaps up to $9.50, you don't buy (can reassess)
- ✅ Professional traders use limits, not markets

---

### Step 6: Monitor the Fill (9:30 - 10:00 AM)

**Market opens at 9:30 AM ET.**

Set a reminder to check at **9:35 AM** (5 minutes after open).

---

#### Scenario A: Order Fills Immediately ✅

**9:31 AM - Notification:**
```
Robinhood: Your order for 32 SOFI at $9.28 has been filled
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Filled at $9.28 (better than $9.30 limit!)
- Total cost: 32 × $9.28 = $296.96
- You saved $0.02/share vs your limit

**What you do:**
- 📝 Note actual entry price in your log
- ⏭️ Move to Step 7 (set stop loss)

---

#### Scenario B: Order Doesn't Fill ⚠️

**9:35 AM - Check Robinhood:**
```
Order Status: Open
Buy 32 SOFI @ $9.30 Limit
Current price: $9.45
```

**What happened:**
- Stock gapped up at open to $9.45
- Your $9.30 limit is below the current price
- Order sits unfilled

**Decision time - What do you do?**

**Option 1: Cancel and move on** (Conservative)
- Thesis was to buy near $9.25
- At $9.45, you're paying 2% more
- Pass and wait for next signal
- **Best if:** Signal was marginal to begin with

**Option 2: Raise limit to current price** (Moderate)
- Cancel old order
- Place new limit at $9.45
- Only if thesis still strong
- **Best if:** Signal is very strong (rank score >10)

**Option 3: Wait for pullback** (Patient)
- Keep limit at $9.30
- Watch during day for dip
- Cancel at 3:59 PM if never fills
- **Best if:** You have time to monitor

**For this example: Assume Option 1 - filled at $9.28** ✅

---

### Step 7: Set Stop Loss (Immediately After Fill)

**9:35 AM - As soon as you're filled, protect yourself.**

**CRITICAL:** Do this within 5 minutes of entry. No exceptions.

---

#### How to Set Stop Loss on Robinhood:

1. **Go to your SOFI position**
   - Tap "Investing" tab
   - Find SOFI in your holdings
   - Tap to open

2. **Tap "Trade"**
   - Then "Sell"

3. **Enter quantity**
   - Type: 32 shares (all of them)

4. **Change order type**
   - Tap "Market" → Change to "Stop Loss"

5. **Set stop price**
   - Enter: $8.75
   - (Your predetermined -5% stop)

6. **Set time in force**
   - Select: **"GTC"** (Good-Til-Canceled)
   - This keeps the order active indefinitely

7. **Review**
   ```
   Sell 32 SOFI
   Stop Loss @ $8.75
   GTC
   ```

8. **Submit**

---

**How it works:**
- If SOFI drops to $8.75, it triggers a market sell
- Your shares automatically sell around $8.75
- Limits your loss to ~$16 (-5.4%)
- You don't have to watch the stock constantly

**Common question:** *"What if it dips to $8.75 then recovers?"*
- **Answer:** You're stopped out. Accept it. Move on.
- This is the cost of risk management
- 1-2% of the time you'll get stopped and miss a recovery
- 98% of the time, the stop saves you from bigger losses

---

### Step 8: Set Take-Profit (Optional but Recommended)

**Also set an automatic take-profit order.**

---

#### How to Set Take-Profit on Robinhood:

1. **While still in SOFI position**
   - Tap "Trade" → "Sell"

2. **Enter quantity**
   - Type: 32 shares

3. **Change order type**
   - Tap "Market" → Change to "Limit"

4. **Set limit price**
   - Enter: $10.00
   - (Your +8% target)

5. **Set time in force**
   - Select: "GTC"

6. **Review**
   ```
   Sell 32 SOFI
   Limit $10.00
   GTC
   ```

7. **Submit**

---

**How it works:**
- If SOFI hits $10.00, your shares automatically sell
- Locks in $24 profit without you doing anything
- Removes emotion from taking profits
- Prevents you from getting greedy

**Now you have TWO orders active:**
- Stop Loss at $8.75 (protects downside)
- Limit Sell at $10.00 (captures upside)

**One of these will execute eventually. You're set!**

---

### Step 9: Track the Position (Next 3 Weeks)

**Now you wait. Check periodically but don't obsess.**

---

#### Week 1 (Nov 3-8):

**Monday (Day 1) - Entry**
- Entered at $9.28

- Target set at $10.00

- Your thought: *"Nice, trending right direction"*
- Action: None (orders are set)

**Wednesday**

- Stock up 5% after hours to $10.25

**Thursday Morning**
- 🔔 **9:35 AM - Your phone buzzes**

```

```

- Stock gapped up to $10.15 at open
- Your limit sell at $10.00 executed automatically
- **Position closed at target!** ✅

---

### Step 10: Calculate Your Result

**Position closed. Time to tally up.**

```

---

### Step 11: Log the Trade

**Update your tracking spreadsheet:**

| Date | Ticker | Entry | Exit | Shares | P/L | % | Days | Score | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|------|--------|-----|---|------|-------|-------|
| 11/3 | SOFI | $9.28 | $10.00 | 32 | +$23 | +7.8% | 9 | 9.22 | Earnings beat triggered early exit |

---

**Why track every trade?**
- Verifies your personal hit rate vs backtest
- Identifies which signals work best for YOU
- Improves decision-making over time
- Required for tax reporting
- Keeps you honest about results

---

## Alternative Scenarios

Not every trade goes perfectly. Here's what happens when things go wrong:

---

### Scenario B: Stop Loss Triggered 📉

**Week 1 - Wednesday:**
- SOFI drops to $8.90 on Tuesday
- Further drops to $8.75 on Wednesday morning
- **9:45 AM - Your phone buzzes:**

```
Robinhood: Your stop loss order for 32 SOFI at $8.75 has been triggered
Sold at $8.73 (market order)
```

**Result:**
```
Entry:  32 × $9.28 = $296.96
Exit:   32 × $8.73 = $279.36
Loss:   -$17.60 (-5.9%)
```

**What you do:**
1. Accept the loss (it happens)
2. Log it in your spreadsheet
3. Move on to the next signal
4. **DO NOT:**
   - Try to "revenge trade" to make it back
   - Double your position size on the next signal
   - Second-guess your stop loss system

**Lesson:** Signal didn't work this time. Your stop loss protected you from a bigger loss. This is the cost of doing business.

---

### Scenario C: Time Stop - No Movement ⏰

**Week 3 (Nov 24):**
- Entry: $9.28
- Current price: $9.30
- Gain: +$0.02/share = +0.2% (basically nothing)
- 3 weeks have passed

**Decision Time:**
```
Option 1: Exit at breakeven
- Capital isn't working
- Could deploy in better signal
- Take the minor win and move on

Option 2: Give it one more week
- Only if fundamentals still strong
- Earnings or catalyst coming up
- Set hard deadline: Exit by Friday

Option 3: Adjust target
- Lower target to $9.75 (+5%)
- Accept smaller win for faster exit
```

**You choose Option 1:**
- Cancel your $10 limit sell
- Place market order, sell at $9.32
- Net result: +$0.04/share = +$1.28 total (+0.4%)

**Outcome:** Tiny win, but capital freed for next signal ✅

---

### Scenario D: Urgent Alert - Highly Actionable 🚨

**Tuesday Morning - 7:05 AM:**

You receive TWO emails:
1. Daily Report
2. **URGENT Insider Alert**

```
🚨 URGENT Insider Alert — November 5, 2025

High-conviction cluster buys detected.

PLTR (Palantir Technologies)
  • Insiders: CEO Karp, CFO Sankar, Director Thiel, Director Cohen
  • Cluster Score: 4
  • Conviction Score: 15.20
  • Total Reported: $1,200,000
  • Current Price: $25.50
  • 8.2% above 52-week low
  • Rank Score: 14.52
  • Suggested Action: URGENT: Consider small entry at open / immediate review
  • Rationale: Cluster count:4 | Total reported buys: $1,200,000
```

**What makes this urgent:**
- ✅ 4 insiders (very rare)
- ✅ $1.2M total (large dollar amount)
- ✅ CEO + CFO buying (highest conviction)
- ✅ Score 14.52 (very high)
- ✅ Near 52-week low (value entry)

**What you do differently:**
1. **Prioritize this signal** over others
2. **Increase position size** (if comfortable):
   - Normal: 3% = $300
   - Urgent: 4% = $400 (still controlled)
3. **Faster research** (but still do it!)
4. **Tighter stops** (-4% instead of -5%)
5. **Higher target** (+12% instead of +8%)

**Why urgent matters:**
- These signals have historically higher hit rates
- Rare occurrence (1-2 per month)
- Multiple insiders = strong conviction
- Worth taking more seriously

---

## Key Principles for Success

### ✅ DO:

1. **Always use position sizing** (2-5% max per signal)
2. **Always set stop losses** before price can move against you
3. **Always take profits at targets** (don't get greedy)
4. **Always track your results** (spreadsheet or app)
5. **Always do quick research** (10-15 min minimum)
6. **Always be patient** (wait for good setups)
7. **Always follow your plan** (no emotional deviations)

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't oversize positions** (>5% = too risky)
2. **Don't skip stop losses** ("it'll come back" = disaster)
3. **Don't hold forever** (these are tactical, not buy-and-hold)
4. **Don't chase gaps** (if it runs away, let it go)
5. **Don't panic sell on small dips** (stop loss handles that)
6. **Don't trade on margin** (master cash first)
7. **Don't revenge trade after losses** (emotional trading loses money)
8. **Don't follow every signal blindly** (do your research)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Not Setting Stop Losses

**What happens:**
- You buy SOFI at $9.25
- It drops to $8.00 (-13.5%)
- You think "it'll come back"
- It drops to $6.50 (-30%)
- Now you're stuck in a big loss

**Fix:** Set stop loss immediately. Always.

---

### Mistake #2: Moving Stop Losses Lower

**What happens:**
- You set stop at $8.75
- Stock drops to $8.80
- You think "just a bit more room"
- Move stop to $8.25
- Stock keeps dropping
- You lose more than planned

**Fix:** NEVER move stops lower. Only move them up (trailing).

---

### Mistake #3: Not Taking Profits

**What happens:**
- You buy at $9.25, target $10.00
- Stock hits $10.05
- You think "it might go to $11!"
- It drops back to $9.40
- You missed easy profit

**Fix:** Take profits at targets. You can always re-enter.

---

### Mistake #4: Oversizing Positions

**What happens:**
- Signal looks "really good"
- You put 15% of portfolio in
- It drops 10%
- You lose 1.5% of entire portfolio in one trade
- Takes 5+ winning trades to recover

**Fix:** Stick to 2-5% per position. No exceptions.

---

### Mistake #5: Not Doing Research

**What happens:**
- Email says "buy SOFI"
- You buy immediately without checking
- Turns out there's a lawsuit announced yesterday
- Stock tanks
- Signal was good, but timing was bad

**Fix:** Always spend 10-15 minutes researching first.

---

## Tracking Your Results

### Create a Simple Spreadsheet

**Minimum columns:**
- Date (entry)
- Ticker
- Entry price
- Exit price
- Shares
- Profit/Loss ($)
- Profit/Loss (%)
- Days held
- Signal score
- Outcome (target/stop/time)
- Notes

**Example:**

```
Date     | Ticker | Entry | Exit  | P/L   | %     | Days | Score | Outcome | Notes
---------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|---------|-------
11/3/25  | SOFI   | $9.28 | $10.00| +$23  | +7.8% | 9    | 9.22  | Target  | Earnings beat
11/5/25  | PLTR   | $25.50| $24.20| -$26  | -5.1% | 3    | 14.52 | Stop    | Macro selloff
11/10/25 | RDDT   | $45.30| $47.85| +$51  | +5.6% | 7    | 6.80  | Target  | Good momentum
```

---

### Calculate Your Stats Monthly

**Key metrics:**
- Total trades
- Win rate (% profitable)
- Average winner
- Average loser
- Profit factor (total wins / total losses)
- Average days held
- Total return

**Example after 10 trades:**
```
Trades: 10
Winners: 6 (60%)
Losers: 4 (40%)
Avg winner: +8.2%
Avg loser: -5.1%
Profit factor: 1.45
Total return: +2.8% (on capital deployed)
```

---

## Advanced Tips (After 3+ Months Experience)

### Tip #1: Trailing Stop Losses

Once a position is up 5%, move your stop to breakeven:

**Example:**
```
Entry: $9.28
Initial stop: $8.75 (-5.7%)
Stock moves to $9.75 (+5.1%)

New stop: $9.30 (breakeven)
```

**Why:** Protects profits. If it reverses, you lose nothing.

### Tip #2: Scaling Out

Instead of all-or-nothing, sell in tranches:

**Example:**
```
32 shares entered at $9.28

Sell 16 shares at $10.00 (+7.8%) = Lock in $11.52 profit
Let 16 shares run to $10.50 target
Or stop out at $9.30 breakeven

Result: Partial profit secured, still have upside exposure
```

### Tip #3: Correlating with Sector Trends

Track if certain sectors perform better with insider signals:

**Example observations:**
- Fintech signals (SOFI, UPST) → 65% hit rate
- Tech signals (PLTR, SNOW) → 58% hit rate
- Biotech signals → 45% hit rate (avoid?)

**Adjust:** Focus on sectors with proven results in YOUR tracking.

### Tip #4: Earnings Calendar Awareness

Check if earnings are coming up:

**Before Earnings (1-2 weeks out):**
- ✅ Insider buying before earnings = potentially bullish
- ✅ They may know results are good
- ⚠️ Higher volatility risk

**Right After Earnings:**
- ⚠️ Be cautious - volatility high
- ✅ If insiders buy AFTER bad earnings = strong signal

---

### Tip #5: Combining with Technical Analysis

Add simple technical filters:

**Before entering, check:**
- ✅ Stock above 20-day moving average = healthier
- ✅ RSI < 70 = not overbought
- ✅ Volume increasing = confirmation
- ❌ Stock in clear downtrend = avoid

**This can improve hit rate 3-5%.**

**Good luck, stay disciplined, and trade safely!** 🚀📈
