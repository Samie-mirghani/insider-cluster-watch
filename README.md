# insider-cluster-watch
Automated pipeline to detect and score insider open-market buys (Form 4), generate a daily HTML/plain-text email report with ranked signals, and optionally wire to brokers later. Built as a DIY-first, low-cost stack: Python scripts + GitHub Actions scheduler + SendGrid (or Gmail) for email. Start paper-only; no automatic trading.
